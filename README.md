## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had a hard time adjusting the image for responsive layout.

In order to make the image fit, I had to use object-fit in the mobile version:

```css
img {
  /* avoid stretching the image --> */
  object-fit: contain;
}
```

For the desktop version, I had to use below code in order to avoid a thin purple line to the right of the image.

```css
img {
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

The above is a bit "hacky". Not sure what a better solution is at this point.
